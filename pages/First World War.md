<h1>The First World War: A Global Catastrophe</h1><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img alt="world-war" src="/images/download__1_.jpeg"></div><p>The First World War, also known as the Great War, was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918. It involved most of the worldâ€™s nations, divided into two opposing alliances: the Central Powers (mainly Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire) and the Allied Powers (mainly France, Britain, Russia, Italy, Japan and the United States). <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/world-war-i-history" class="tooltip-target" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The war was triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo, Bosnia, on June 28, 1914</a><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/world-war-i-history" class="ac-anchor sup-target" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1</a><a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I" class="ac-anchor sup-target" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2</a>. This event set off a chain of diplomatic crises, ultimatums, mobilizations and declarations of war that soon engulfed Europe and the world.</p><p>The war was fought on multiple fronts, including the Western Front in France and Belgium, where the armies of Germany and the Allies faced each other in a bloody stalemate of trench warfare; the Eastern Front in Russia and Poland, where the Russian army battled the Central Powers until the Russian Revolution of 1917; the Italian Front in the Alps, where Italy fought against Austria-Hungary; the Balkan Front in Serbia, Greece and Romania, where the Allies supported the Serbs against the Central Powers; the Middle Eastern Front in Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia, where the British and the Arabs fought against the Ottoman Empire; and the African Front in various colonies, where the British, French and Belgians fought against the Germans. The war also saw the first use of new weapons and technologies, such as machine guns, poison gas, tanks, airplanes, submarines and radio.</p><p>The war had devastating consequences for millions of people. <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-world-war" class="tooltip-target" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">It is estimated that about 16 million soldiers and civilians died and another 21 million were wounded as a result of the war</a><a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-world-war" class="ac-anchor sup-target" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">3</a><a href="https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/first-world-war-1914-1918/" class="ac-anchor sup-target" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">4</a>. The war also caused widespread famine, disease, displacement and social unrest. The war also changed the political map of the world, as four empires collapsed: the Russian, the German, the Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman. The war also led to the creation of new states, such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Turkey, and the emergence of new ideologies, such as communism, fascism and nationalism. The war also paved the way for the Second World War, as the Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war in 1919, imposed harsh terms on Germany, such as reparations, territorial losses and military restrictions, that fueled resentment and anger among the Germans.</p><p>The First World War was a tragic and transformative event in human history, that shaped the 20th century and beyond. It was a war that exposed the horrors of modern warfare, the fragility of civilization and the complexity of international relations. It was a war that challenged the values, beliefs and identities of millions of people. It was a war that left a lasting legacy of memory, trauma and hope.</p>
